# lazyBG

lazyBG is a backgammon match transcription assistant. It uses [GNU
Backgammon](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg), a sophisticated neural net
based multi-ply evalution engine to get candidate checker moves during the
transcription process.

I cheerfully thank Rami Ker√§nen alias [foochu](https://github.com/foochu) for
porting GNU Backgammon engine checker evaluation to Go.
